# for app development, include all the following pods
target 'YOUR_TARGET_NAME' do
    pod 'AEPTarget'
    pod 'AEPCore'
end
```

### [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager)

    .target(name: "YourTarget",
            dependencies: ["AEPTarget"],
	    path: "your/path")
]
```
